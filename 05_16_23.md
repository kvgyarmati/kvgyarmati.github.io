Rando thought for the day... Dactyl Manuform Keyboard ! 

## Ergo for work and life 

Like with everything else in most people's day work takes the majority of my time. 
Also my hobbies include learning a few programing langauges, and with all that stated I 
spend most of my time on the computer interacting. 

So I swapped my standard issue membrain keyboard for a mechanical keyboard, **Redragon K552-KR**. 
I really liked the switch change, and noticed that I wasn't having as much finger tip pain from, 
mashing the keys with such force. 

Near the end of '21 I was looking to go on a job site, and wanted to travel with my keyboard 
however even with it being a tenkeyless model I felt I needed a little bit smaller version.

I ended up getting a 60% TRI-bluetooth keyboard **Redragon K530RGB** . Totally love the design
and the idea of functional layers on the keyboard. After a year and a half rocking this keyboard 
I have been branching out to see if there is another option to lessen the strain being felt in my
wrists and forearms. 

During my research also found Alpha gripz , rubberband workout for your grip. This has helped 
a lot by building up the forearm flexor tendants yet I am feeling it could be so much better 
if I split the keyboard. 

Then I found the dactyl manuform DIY keyboard. This directly has been scratching my creative 
desires from the ideas of printing the cases, handwiring, and to design of my key mapping.

Now is the time to push the **GO** button and order the needed parts to complete the build, and
then get to it! 

Well If I have time later I will post more. 

Peace
