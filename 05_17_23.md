Hello everyone! 

## Thought of the day 

To have single key LEDs or not? 

---- 

## What else is going on? 

Disaster Recovery  ~ working on my annual review of my personal data to be ready if I have a computer crash etc. 

Thinking around the 4 phases: 

Mitigation 

Preparedness 

Response 

Recovery

Within the current digital life we live, there are tons of way to fulfil each of these.  

I can run through these a little more so at a later day but we will see.

## Outro 

Well currently this is all I had time for on a quick afternoon break / lunch. 

Peace
