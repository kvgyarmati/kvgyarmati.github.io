# Welcome to my Github page(s) 

Thank you for taking a minute to review my quick github pages site. 

Now down to the quick and dirty. 

## What to expect 

This site is created to allow a personal showcase of what I am working on beyond the standard commits, and to highly some direct commits. 

Also will be a landing page to share my info and more.
